This project was overseen by Dr. Philip von Doetinchem and worked on in collaboration with Martin Adra.

For this project, two C++ toolkits were used: GEANT4 (for the simulation of the SEEs detector scintillator) and ROOT (for the analysis of the simulations). Both toolkits were developed and published by CERN.

There were several objectives for this project:
1. To determine the dimensions, materials, and geometry of the SEEs detector.
2. For each iteration of the above, to determine the energy deposition of low-energy solar electrons (between 250 keV-2000 keV) and protons (between 10 MeV-70 MeV).
3. Lastly, to compare the energy deposition levels between protons and electrons to determine if there is a visible difference between detection for future data analysis.

During my time on the project, we primarily focused on a six-layer scintillator detector. Each layer is made of polyvinyltoluene (PVT) and wrapped in 99.0% light-tight aluminum, each layer increasing in thickness. The overall detector is encased in a copper box with an aperture in the front. A more specific visualization of this information can be found in the file 'gaps_run.mac'.
